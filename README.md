# AI-Driven-Heart-Attack-Risk-Prediction-Using-Clinical-Parameters
End-to-end Machine Learning project that analyzes clinical data to predict heart attack risk and assist in early preventive healthcare decision-making.

Project Description
This project focuses on predicting the risk of heart attack using machine learning techniques. 
It analyzes clinical parameters such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol level, heart rate, and other medical attributes to determine the likelihood of a heart attack.

The system aims to assist in early detection and preventive healthcare decision-making by providing risk predictions based on trained ML models.

 Objectives
- Perform data preprocessing and cleaning
- Train supervised machine learning models
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Develop a simple web-based interface for prediction

Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Flask / Streamlit
